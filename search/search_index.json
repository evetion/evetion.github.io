I'm a researcher at Deltares and an external PhD candidate in the 3dgeoinfo research group at the Delft University of Technology. I have earned a Master of Science degree in Geomatics with honors.</p> <p>My research concerns elevation modelling, especially in lowlands prone to coastal flooding. I aim to combine my interests in remote sensing and software engineering for societal impact. Currently, I'm working on applying data from ICESat-2\u2014a lidar satellite\u2014on global elevation models.</p> <p>I promote open and reproducible research, and I'm the author of several open-source software packages for handling geospatial data, written in the Julia programming language. In my free time I tinker with open data, but I also read, write, climb, boulder, mountaineer, and ride a motorbike.</p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Papers","text":"<p>For a current overview, see my ORCID and Google Scholar profiles.</p>"},{"location":"notes/2023/12/13/detecting-embankments/","title":"Detecting embankments","text":"<p>This is a placeholder for the AGU poster presentation</p>"},{"location":"notes/2023/12/31/all-dems-are-wrong-some-are-useful/","title":"All DEMs are wrong, some are useful","text":"<p>Digital Elevation Models are still models, so I assume the proverb by George Box still applies.</p>","tags":["DeltaDTM","FABDEM","DiluviumDEM","DTM","DSM"]},{"location":"notes/2023/12/03/hello-world/","title":"Hello World","text":"<p>Hey there, welcome to my research notes, or blog.</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n  A[Start PhD] --&gt; B{Bad at writing?};\n  B --&gt;|Yes| C[Hmm...];\n  C --&gt; D[Start blogging];\n  D --&gt; B;\n  B ----&gt;|No| E[Start thesis];</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/2023/12/03/hello-world/#why","title":"Why?","text":"<p>In the past two year of my PhD I noticed several things:</p> <ul> <li>I'm not particularly good at writing</li> <li>I had several ideas and opinions that I wanted to share, but they didn't fit in a paper</li> </ul> <p>Of course, to improve writing, one needs to write more.
