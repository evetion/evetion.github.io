I'm a researcher at Deltares and an external PhD candidate in the 3dgeoinfo research group at the Delft University of Technology. I have earned a Master of Science degree in Geomatics with honors.</p> <p>My research concerns elevation modelling, especially in lowlands prone to coastal flooding. I aim to combine my interests in remote sensing and software engineering for societal impact. Currently, I'm working on applying data from ICESat-2\u2014a lidar satellite\u2014on global elevation models.</p> <p>I promote open and reproducible research, and I'm the author of several open-source software packages for handling geospatial data, written in the Julia programming language. In my free time I tinker with open data, but I also read, write, climb, boulder, mountaineer, and ride a motorbike.</p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Papers","text":"<p>For a current overview, see my ORCID and Google Scholar profiles.</p>"},{"location":"notes/2023/12/13/detecting-embankments/","title":"Global identification of levees and their heights for flood inundation mapping","text":"<p>This is a digital version of the AGU23 poster H31Z-1861.</p> <p> </p> Levees colored by volume as detected by our method for the Dutch polder landscape using CopernicusDEM."},{"location":"notes/2023/12/13/detecting-embankments/#why","title":"Why","text":"<p>While levees are important assets in natural hazard risk assessments, accurate information in the public domain about the location and height of these embankments is often missing.

(2018), who used radar-based flood maps, together with gauge information to detect embankments.
