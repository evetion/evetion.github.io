## About

I'm Maarten Pronk, currently working as a researcher and advisor at [Deltares](https://deltares.nl). I have a masters degree in Geomatics, obtained at the [TU Delft](https://tudelft.nl) in the [3dgeoinfo](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) research group. My thesis dealt with storing massive TINs (a whole *lot* of triangles) in a spatial database.

In my work I like to combine my skillset in IT and GIS, while working on open source projects. I strive to constantly learn new things and connect these pieces of information. 

In my free time I tinker with open data, but I also climb, boulder, mountaineer and read books.

for those who wonder about the name of the site: evetion is a combination of two latin words, *probably* resembling something youthful and innovative, but now long forgotten.
